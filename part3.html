	<h1>Site Specification</h1>	
<p>Intended audience: I am the client for this website. I decided to change it to a personal and professionaly website for myself. So, the intended audience for now is recruiters since I will post my resume on the site, along with friends and family that want to keep up with what is going on in my life as I will be posting personal social media accounts, photos, updates, etc.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Mission statement(tentative): To put myself on display personally and professionally as un-narcissistically as possible and further my reach in the world.
	</p>
	<br>
<p>Requirements: As the client, I want the site to show a brief background on who I am, where I live, what I do, my professional resume, what interests me, activities I take part in, causes I care about, pictures I take, and anything else I see fit to add.
</p>
<br>
	<p>Feasible?: Yes.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>I will me the main judge of the site's success. Since it is for now a personal site, the success can be judged by the fact people are looking at it and talking to me about it. Monetarily, nothing will be made from this site directly, but if a recruiter sees it and contacts me because of it, I will consider it a total success. This may evolve over time, though. 
	</p>
<br>
<p>Target audience: Recruiters, family, friends. Recruiters will probably be more on the technical side if they're browsing my site for recruiting purposes.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Limiting technical factors are the web host's available space that I have to use and my own technical abilities.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>I'm doing all the work myself so there is no budget! yay! And each week new milestones are set based on classroom assignments.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>New site!</p>
	
	<h1>Web structure</h1>
	<p>The reason behind choosing the web structure design for my site was for high accessibility for users. They can get to any page from any page on the site, and since my site only has a few pages, this is important for users to be able to see all the pages easily. It just makes sense on a small personal site. It suits my content because it's all about me. There are no directions to follow or explicit routes to take.</p>
