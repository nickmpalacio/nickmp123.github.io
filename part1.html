		<h1>Project proposal</h1>
		<h2>Site title:</h2>
		
		San Francisco Bars, Venues, and Inbetweens
		<br/>
		<h2>Developer:</h2>
		
		Nick Palacio
		<br>
		<h2>Focus:</h2>
		
		The focus of my website is going to be both informational and serve as a resource. I'll give reviews about bars, clubs and other spots I've been to in San Francisco. I will also detail experiences with specific shows I've attended at these venues. I'm going to try to convey to readers the general vibe of each location as well as the clientele. Lastly I'll provide insight as to whether or not each location is worth checking out.
		<br>
		<h2>Main elements outline:</h2>
		
		My website will have a few links at the top to distinguish between Bars, Club, and other venues. Once one of these is clicked, it will lead to a new page with all the locations in that category on one page. All of the links at the top of the page will still be visible after one of them is clicked on to remain consistent and visually appealing.
		<br>
		<h2>content:</h2>
		
		As of now, I am thinking the website will have a page for each link at the top of the home page. For example, the bars will all be on one page and clubs will all be on another page of their own. I'm still putting together the complete list of places that I will do a write-up on and right now I have about 15 different places. Another page that I am thinking of including is a page with all of the addresses and contact information to the venues. 
		<br>
		<h2>Target audience:</h2>
		
		The target audience for my site will be people that are interested in the different places to go out in San Francisco but are unfamiliar with them. Also, if someone is considering going to a specific show or seeing a certain DJ at a venue, they can get a better idea of what it will be like because I am going to talk about my experience seeing shows there (if I have). This site can be used by people that are planning a visit to SF or even people currently living in the Bay Area that haven't been to some of the places I have in the city.
		<br>
		<h2>Design considerations:</h2>
		
		I want the pages on this site to look sleek and uncluttered. Also, I want to include personal pictures or pictures already on the internet to include with the reviews and write ups for each venue. If possible, I would also like to include videos or songs that I heard while at the specific club or show.
		<br>
		<h2>limiting factors:</h2>
		
		My knowledge of HTML is a work in progress, so I'm not sure if I'll be advanced enough to add audio clips for the write ups. I believe the web host limits the size of the website to no mroe than 250MB as well. Other than that I believe I'll be able to put together a useful and clean looking website.
